# UnrarMovies
A little program to unrar movies and sorting them to the right folder.
It parses the movieinfo thru OMDB to get ratings,voters,runtime,genre and more which you can use to send an email thru gmail when finished.
Also have an option to send this new info to kodi/xbmc so that you dont have to manually rescan the library.
Works on Nas with mono.
